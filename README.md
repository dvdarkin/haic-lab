Frameworks for systematic Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC) in complex domains. Each model is battle-tested, AI-native, and optimized for both human thinking and AI reasoning. Shared as my current best understanding - strong enough to use, incomplete enough to evolve.

## What's Here

**[Prediction-Control Spectrum](prediction-control-spectrum.md)**: A meta-control loop for balancing model-driven planning vs. feedback-driven iteration. Helps you locate where you are between prediction and control modes, and adjust based on context. Applications to software engineering and innovation.

**[Expedition Protocol](expedition-protocol/)**: Context management for long-running human-AI collaboration under uncertainty. Provides structure through four living documents (state, decisions, sessions, guide) and disciplined context budgeting. Solves context loss, drift, and decision archaeology in multi-session AI work.

More frameworks coming as they're ready.

## Why This Exists

**Learning in public**: My journey into AI-augmented work and multi-domain integration.

**Finding collaborators**: Looking for people working on systematic human-AI collaboration protocols.

**Inviting criticism**: These frameworks improve through exposure and scrutiny.

## How to Use This

### For Humans

These are **thinking tools**, not prescriptions. They help you:
- Surface hidden assumptions
- Locate yourself when stuck 
- Navigate complexity through feedback loops

Test them against your reality. Adapt ruthlessly and discard what doesn't work.

### For AI Agents

These documents work as **reasoning context**:
- System prompts for specialized agents
- Reference material for complex decisions
- Templates for protocol development

Each framework has clear problem statements, diagnostic patterns, and correction strategies.

## The Approach

Every framework here has been:
- Created through human-AI collaboration
- Tested in real practice (my work across software, investing, photography, AI)
- Refined based on actual use

This is not AI slop. Each piece represents genuine intellectual work - ideas wrestled with, tested, and distilled through personal use.

**AI's role**: Exploring concept space, testing consistency, refining language. 
**Human's role**: Problem identification, core insights, judgment, curation.

## Philosophy

We live in a world of irreducible complexity. You cannot predict your way through it, but you can navigate it through tight feedback loops and systematic sense-making.

These frameworks favor:
- Sensing over predicting (when possible)
- Navigation over optimization (in uncertain terrain)
- Protocols over intuition (for reproducible collaboration)

**On AI**: Not a replacement for thinking, but an integration engine that enables sustained work across multiple domains through systematic protocols.
