```

## Decisions

### 2025-01-10 - Selected Python over Node.js

**Context**: Starting implementation, needed to choose primary language.

**Decision**: Use Python for core implementation.

**Rationale**: 
- Better library support for our data processing needs
- Team familiarity
- Easier integration with ML tools if needed later

**Outcome**: TBD

### 2025-01-12 - Adopted Expedition Protocol

**Context**: Multiple sessions losing context, re-explaining same things.

**Decision**: Implement four living documents pattern (state, decisions, sessions, guide).

**Rationale**:
- Hard context budget forces prioritization
- Sessions as archive eliminates summary drift
- Decision log makes "why X?" answerable

**Outcome**: TBD

*Add new decisions at the bottom. Update outcomes when known.*
